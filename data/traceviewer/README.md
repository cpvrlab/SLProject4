# SLProject Trace Viewer

The SLProject Trace Viewer is used to open and display the trace files (.slt)
generated by the new profiler in the "utils" module.

There are three ways to open a trace file:

- Open (Ctrl + O): To open a trace file that has been generated in advance
- Reopen Last (Ctrl + R): To reopen the last opened file (remembered when the application closes)
- Profile (Ctrl + P): To automatically let the application execute the following sequence:
    - Creates a "profiling" CMake configuration in the selected SLProject directory
    - Defines the "PROFILE" macro in the "Profiler.h" header
    - Builds the application
    - Runs it
    - Loads the generated trace file after the application exits

To move right and left, use the D and A keys, drag the trace with your mouse, or hold SHIFT and scroll with the mouse
wheel. To zoom in and out, use the W and S keys or scroll with your mouse wheel. To speed up moving and zooming, hold
CTRL. Details for a particular scope will be displayed in the panel at the bottom when clicked.

**Important**: The resulting trace gets written into the data folder of SLProject and can
be opened using the trace viewer located at /externals/trace-viewer/trace-viewer.jar.
Note that a Java Runtime Environment is required to launch this JAR archive.
